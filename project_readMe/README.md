## Description
So basically everyone knows about how money is the root of all evil but no one talks about the fate of all evil, lemme esplain, basically if money is the root of all evil then the fate of all evil the creation of big incorporations like the big mcdoncalds that everyone just loves, people use the money to get basic needs and things of that sort but no one really understands the materialism in the evil that the money has created, think of god and his loving grace upon all things evil, he makes the will of evil and manifests it into something different entirely something wholesome something used to be worshipped and remade into cultish like behavior, speaking of cults image that the christian faith is that, a cult, but no one really understands the logic behind that, what really seperates the meaning of religion and cultish behavior? is it the intention behind them or the people that build it. What really proves whether cult behavior is right and religion is wrong. I know what it is, its the band wagoning of the masses. People only believe what religion is based off the roots of the masses and the sewing of many ideas and theologies that grow and fester inside a society.
